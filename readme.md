üß™ 6. Testing and Debugging
math_test_suite: Write tests for a math utility library.
Tasks:

Add unit tests with #[test]

Test edge cases

Use assert_eq! and should_panic

bug_hunter_game: Intentionally buggy game logic for debugging practice.
Tasks:

Find and fix logical bugs

Use println!, dbg!, and cargo test

Optional: Use debugger (e.g., LLDB with VSCode)

test_coverage_tracker: Track test coverage manually.
Tasks:

Annotate which functions are tested

Write integration tests

Use Rust‚Äôs cargo test with custom output

üí¨ 7. Error Handling

error_chain_demo: Build your own error types with thiserror.
Tasks:

Define enums for different error kinds

Implement From for conversions

Chain errors with context

üßµ 8. Concurrency / Async Basics
parallel_downloader: Simulate downloading multiple files in parallel.
Tasks:

Spawn threads for each download

Use thread::spawn, join

Print progress of each

async_timer: Create an async task scheduler.
Tasks:

Use tokio::time::sleep or similar

Await multiple timers
